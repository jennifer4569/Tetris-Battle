DESCRIPTION
=====================================================================================================================
   We implemented Tetris Battle, a PvP version of the classic video game Tetris. The game involves trying to 
   achieve the highest possible score, while simultaneously trying to survive longer than your opponent. 
   Additionally, on top of attempting to outlast your opponent, you also have the ability to make the game 
   harder for your opponent by adding partially complete rows to their grid, which could lead to their 
   disqualification.

   There is be a central server (67.205.133.16), which accepts up to 32 clients at once. The central server 
   authenticates the usersâ€™ login, and stores various statistics about each user, as well as a leaderboard. 
   It also automatically performs matchmaking for each user who wishes to play.

   NOTE: To be able to run the program, you must have JDK installed.

HOW TO USE THE PROGRAM
=====================================================================================================================
   Users will need to be logged in to play the game:
      - If you are a new user, you will need to register for a new account. Click "Register" on the toolbar.
        NOTE: The username and password must be 5-20 characters long, and only contain alphanumeric characters!
      - If you are a returning user, you can log in by clicking "Login" on the toolbar.

   Upon successfully registering/logging in, you will receive a message telling you that you've successfully 
   logged in.
   
   After you log in, you can play the game, as well as access your player stats.
   To play, click "Play" on the toolbar. You will then be placed in a matchmaking queue, and will be notified when
   an opponent connects. See the "HOW TO PLAY" section below for more details on how to play.
   
=====================================================================================================================
HOW TO PLAY
=====================================================================================================================
   The controls of the game are as follows:
      - Left and right arrow keys to move the piece left and right
      - Up and down arrow keys to rotate the piece clockwise and counter-clockwise
      - D to accelerate the piece downwards
      - Space to drop the piece
   A row is considered complete when there are does not exist a tile in the row that is not occupied by a tetromino.
   A piece is considered dropped when it cannot move further downwards.
   The possible piece shapes are as follows:

      - Z:      XX..
                .XX.

      - S:      .XX.
                XX..

      - Line:   XXXX
                ....

      - T:      .X..
                XXX.

      - Square: .XX.
                .XX.

      - L:      ...X
                .XXX

      - Ln't:   X...
                XXX.
   
   After every dropped piece, all complete rows (if any) will be removed, and the rows above them will shift down
   to take its place. If more than one row is completed after a single dropped piece, then the opponent will receive
   one fewer new lines. These new lines will be incomplete, having 1 to 3 gaps. They will be placed at the bottom
   of your opponent's board, with the newer rows being placed lower. These rows may also be completed, and will add
   to the score.

   If a new piece spawns and has no way to move down, then you lose.

USAGES
=====================================================================================================================
   This program is an interesting and amusing way of playing Tetris with friends and family! Have fun while
   battling close friends, and laugh over how you've "screwed over" your opponent by sending them lines! 
   Even without friends to play with, you can still match with another random person, and have a good time!
