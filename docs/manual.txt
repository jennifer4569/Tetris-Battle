DESCRIPTION
=====================================================================================================================
   We implemented Tetris Battle, a PvP version of the classic video game Tetris. The game involves trying to 
   achieve the highest possible score, while simultaneously trying to survive longer than your opponent. 
   Additionally, on top of attempting to outlast your opponent, you also have the ability to make the game 
   harder for your opponent by adding partially complete rows to their grid, which could lead to their 
   disqualification.

   There is be a central server (67.205.133.16), which accepts up to 32 clients at once. The central server 
   authenticates the usersâ€™ login, and stores various statistics about each user, as well as a leaderboard. 
   It also automatically performs matchmaking for each user who wishes to play.

   NOTE: To be able to run the program, you must have JDK installed.

=====================================================================================================================
   This program is an interesting and amusing way of playing Tetris with friends and family! Have fun while
   battling close friends, and laugh over how you've "screwed over" your opponent by sending them lines! 
   Even without friends to play with, you can still match with another random person, and have a good time!
